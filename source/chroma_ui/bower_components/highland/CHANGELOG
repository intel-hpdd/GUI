=========

This file does not aim to be comprehensive (you have git history for that),
rather it lists changes that might impact your own code as a consumer of
this library.

2.0.0
-----

* The `source.merge()` algorithm now evaluates the entire source stream before
  reading from all of the resulting streams in parallel (previously it would
  start reading as soon as the source emitted the next stream)
* The `merge()` function now attempts to balance inputs more fairly. For example,
  if stream A has 100 values buffered and stream B gets a new value after 100ms,
  if we read at 200ms we'll get a value from each stream. Previously it would
  exhaust the stream A buffer before reading from stream B.
